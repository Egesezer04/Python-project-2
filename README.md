📘 Listing Quality Scoring System

A Quality Analyzer for Real Estate / Vehicle / Book Listings using Web Scraping, Selenium, SQLite, OOP, and GUI

This project is a Python-based application designed to scrape listing data from the web and evaluate the quality of each listing.
It uses modern software principles such as object-oriented programming, abstraction, scoring logic, web scraping (Selenium + BeautifulSoup), SQLite database management, and a Tkinter graphical interface.

🚀 Features
✅ Web Scraping

Dynamic page loading using Selenium

HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup

Automatically extracts the first 10 product listings

Uses threading to keep the GUI responsive

✅ Object-Oriented Business Logic

BaseModel — shared base class

Listing — structured listing model

AbstractScorer — scoring interface using abstraction

QualityScorer — full scoring algorithm

Modular, clean, and extensible architecture

Quality evaluation based on:

Title

Price

Description

Image count

✅ SQLite Database

Automatic table creation

Stores Title, Price, Description, Images, Score, Missing Fields

Safe dictionary-based SQL insert

✅ Tkinter GUI

URL input field

“Lets Go” scrape button

Table (TreeView) to display listings

Log message section

Threading support to prevent freezing
